# Words in Political Media

Amalgamation of data for knowing how many times Fox News (and of course everyone else 
i.e. news outlets and media) says "SLAMS" (and other aggressive words). The point is to
see if the words chosen affect the audience via view count and like:dislike ratio based
on view count and average viewership for that channel.

### Usage

To only grab the data, use Dolt: `dolt clone andrew-chen-wang/words-in-political-media`

Otherwise, to manually grab new data from YouTube directly with JSON,
(I'm using Python 3.9) run
`pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py --save-as-json`.
I highly recommend you use a VPN; otherwise, YouTube will throttle you
when you actually want to watch YouTube videos. I highly recommend
you support ProtonVPN, the creators of ProtonMail.

If you'd like to integrate with Dolt instead, you can
simply create an empty dolt database by doing `dolt init`. Note:
I changed the main branch from `master` to `main` on Dolt.

Finally, run `python main.py --save-in-dolt`. You can save it as JSON
at the same time with `python main.py --save-in-dolt --save-as-json`.

### FAQ

> Why did you make this?

I've had this idea for a while, but I never got around to doing it. I created 
[Velnota](https://velnota.com/) to talk about stuff like average Joe's. But 2014-2021
has been pretty messy, and the news is no exception. The talk about fake news,
Fox having a monopoly stake in conservative media, etc. is something I found pretty
interesting.

So this project is just a bit of transparency on corporate media :)

> Why Dolt?

I thought it was an interesting product. Also, as I was creating
the models to store all the data on Dolthub, I realized I didn't
need a `last_updated` attribute for something like "Video.view_count"
which isn't constant and would be updated from time to time.

Ok but if I'm being honest, I just wanted a place to store my data.
Additionally, they didn't have JSON types yet for their database; otherwise,
I would've made some `extra` JSON type attribute for transferring sake.

> Why are some videos missing? Why not a perfectly 20,000 video set per channel?

Initially, all Uploads playlists have 20,000 ish-but-max videos. There are some
privatized videos too. Other times, my internet just dropped, and I honestly couldn't
bother trying to get the lost 20 videos.

> Dolt is taking up too much space. How do I get rid of it?

Run `dolt gc` in the root of your repository. Noms takes up a lot of space.

I've had this idea for a while, but I never got around to doing it.
So here goes nothing...

Credit goes to ProtonVPN and the Proton Team. Without their
VPN, and, no, this isn't sponsored, I would totally get throttled by YouTube
and never be able to experience it again in the name of science.
(man I love such clich√© quotes)... Without the YouTube-DL team, 
this project would not be possible. Thank you all and sponsor them please!
